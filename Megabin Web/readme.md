Users have user accounts

Users have addresses

Users can have roles

Roles can be Admin | User | Driver

Users can Add Addresses, and request a Bin(s) to be delivered 

Payment is handled completely externally

Admins are in charge of managing users and their payments externally

Addresses with Bins get requested for approval by admins, for an admin to approve, it means the user paid for the bin externally

Addresses/Users can create ScheduleContracts - which has a driver collect rubish from the bin on a frequency, on a set day of the week (so every week/2 weeks/3 weeks/monthly)

SchedulleContracts get approved by admins based on external communication and payment.

System calculates schedules for the coming day for all the drivers based on their starting location

System generates a planned list of addresses closest to the driver for addresess and collection and drop off of garbage.

Drivers see this schedule every morning they log on.

Users can see notes and once garbage has been collected for the frequency as well as next collection.

No tracking, No reports, nothing special for admins, they simply manage user accounts, and can create addresses / Schedule Contracts on behalf of users AND approve user requests based on external payments.
