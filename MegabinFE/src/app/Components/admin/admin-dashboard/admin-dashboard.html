<!--
We need to display a dashboard that shows admins 2 main things - ability to view and manage requests / approvals (TODO) and view and manage existing users.
For now, we will focus on the user management part.

<div class="p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Admin Dashboard</h1>
  <app-user-table></app-user-table>
